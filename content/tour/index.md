      - title: Computer Graphics
        content: "We delve into the creation of sophisticated algorithms and models to enhance the generation and manipulation of visual content. Our work spans a wide range of applications, from realistic image synthesis to procedural content generation and digital twins. We are keenly interested in exploring advanced ray-tracing methods to achieve photorealistic rendering, focusing on acceleration structures, global illumination, noise reduction and real-time rendering. Our goal is to push the boundaries of visual fidelity and performance."

      - title: Scientific Visualization and High-Performance Computing
        content: "Our research aims to transform complex scientific data into intuitive and insightful visual representations. We develop novel visualization techniques that aid in the understanding and analysis of large-scale scientific phenomena. We have developed relevant advances in volume rendering, specializing in the visualization of volumetric data, we created efficient and effective rendering techniques that provided high-quality visualizations of 3D scalar fields, commonly used in medical imaging, fluid dynamics, and other scientific domains."
