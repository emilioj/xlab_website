We have freely released UrbanSyn, an open synthetic dataset featuring photorealistic driving scenes with ground-truth annotations. Check it out at http://urbansyn.org.

<!--more-->

UrbanSyn is an open synthetic dataset featuring photorealistic driving scenes. It contains ground-truth annotations for semantic segmentation, scene depth, panoptic instance segmentation, and 2-D bounding boxes.

UrbanSyn is a diverse, compact, and photorealistic dataset that provides more than 7.5k synthetic annotated images. It was born to address the synth-to-real domain gap, contributing to unprecedented synthetic-only baselines used by domain adaptation (DA) methods.
