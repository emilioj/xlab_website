Our work "Immersive 3D Medical Visualization in Virtual Reality using Stereoscopic Volumetric Path Tracing" has been presented at [IEEE VR 2024](https://ieeevr.org/2024/program/papers).

This paper presented an immersive 3D medical visualization system enabling VPT for stereoscopic virtual reality. Our approach combined stereoscopic rendering with state-of-the-art image reprojection and denoising techniques to meet the requirements of VR experiences.
