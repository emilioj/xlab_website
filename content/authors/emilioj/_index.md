Emilio J. Padrón (Ourense, 1975) is both a lecturer and researcher at the Universidade da Coruña (UDC), where he earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2006. His research primarily focuses on High Performance Computing (HPC) and Computer Graphics, exploring their applications in areas such as scientific simulations, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Extended Reality (XR).

Currently, his main research areas are:

- High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) and Big Data, applied to scientific data from large-scale numerical simulations for real-time (in-situ or in-transit) analysis.
- The intersection of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, and AI, with a focus on leveraging AI techniques (such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning) to solve complex problems and drive innovation in these fields.
